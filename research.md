## Gaps & opportunities

- **No proof-of-work step**: Most platforms stop at chat. A structured sprint as the “date” creates real signal and commitment.
- **Weak portfolio signal**: Limited emphasis on GitHub/portfolio/IG or real project history. Opportunity to surface verified work.
- **Low accountability**: Messaging doesn’t guarantee follow-through. Sprint checklists + milestones create shared momentum.
- **Generic matching**: Limited by static filters. Add compatibility around working style, timezone overlap, and sprint velocity.
- **Founder chemistry risk**: Current platforms don’t validate cofounder fit. Sprint outcome provides a concrete decision checkpoint.

## Positioning opportunity for CoFounder Match

- A **dating-style swipe flow** backed by **action-oriented sprints**.
- Pairing is validated by **execution** (build + interviews), not just conversation.
- **Profiles emphasize real work** with GitHub/portfolio/IG, school, and project highlights.
